// A reused index reuses the CEK => two-time-pad on the DEM keystream, so reserve() raises the durable
// high-water before handing out an index: a crash skips indices but never reissues one.

/**
 * A reserved block of ephemeral indices, and the contract every backend must satisfy.
 *
 * The whole point is that an index is never handed out twice: a reissued index reuses the CEK and
 * two-time-pads the note DEM keystream, which publicly links both notes to one wallet.
 *
 * - `reserve(scope, span)` MUST persist the advance BEFORE returning. On return, the durable high-water
 *   is already `base + span`. A backend that returns first and writes later can reissue after a crash.
 * - `commit(usedThrough)` validates which part of the span was used but never lowers the high-water.
 * - `release()` abandons the whole span without lowering the high-water.
 *
 * Durability boundary, stated per gap:
 * - crash between `reserve` and `commit`: the whole reserved span is burned. Never reissued.
 * - crash between `commit` and the next `reserve`: the next base remains `base + span`.
 * - crash during `reserve` itself: either the advance is durable or the call rejected. A backend must
 *   never leave a third state where an index was returned but not persisted.
 *
 * Commit and release burn unused indices because no backend may make a reserved index reusable.
