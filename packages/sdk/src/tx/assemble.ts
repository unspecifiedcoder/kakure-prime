/**
 * Transaction assembly: turn a spendable note plus an intent into the witness a prover consumes.
 *
 * These functions do NOT prove and do NOT submit. For a shielded action the entrypoint's calldata IS the
 * proof, so nothing downstream of proving can be prepared in advance; the honest seam is the witness.
 *
 * Every circuit invariant below is computed here and never accepted as a parameter. That is deliberate: the
 * deleted MixnetWallet passed real packed parents where transfer demands PARENTS_HIDDEN, and picked join
 * inputs in arbitrary order where the circuit asserts ascending index. Both were unreachable through this
 * surface by construction.
