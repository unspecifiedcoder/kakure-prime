/**
 * Transaction planning.
 *
 * This file is PURE on purpose: no chain reads, no Merkle paths, no proving, no storage, no clock. It is a
 * total function of an explicit snapshot, which is what lets it run unchanged in a browser, an MV3 service
 * worker, a mobile app and a relayer, and what lets the Rust client mirror it exactly.
 *
 * WHY A PLANNER AND NOT A SELECTOR. The circuits fix the arity: withdraw and transfer each consume ONE note,
 * split is 1-in-2-out, join is 2-in-1-out. So a target larger than the biggest single note cannot be met by
 * any choice of inputs; it requires consolidating on chain first. A function that returns "the notes to
 * spend" cannot express that, which is why the old helper simply threw `Insufficient funds`.
