/**
 * `MerkleWitnessSource` implementations.
 *
 * All of them are UNTRUSTED by construction, and that is a property of the protocol rather than of any
 * adapter: roots are retained on chain forever, so any historical root is provable against, and `leaf_index`
 * is uniquely determined by `(leaf, root)`. A wrong or hostile witness therefore makes a proof FAIL, it can
 * never make one prove something false. Each source below still verifies locally before returning, so a bad
 * answer surfaces here with a typed error instead of as an opaque proving failure minutes later.
